            <h1>COVID-19 Boosters for Penn Medicine Princeton Health Employees</h1>

            <p>During the flu shot campaign, employees, physicians, allied staff, volunteers, vendors, contractors, and students may also receive optional booster doses of the new bivalent Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, which is designed to provide better protection against the Omicron variant.</p>

            <p>The boosters will be available at the Princeton Medical Center flu vaccination events from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Oct. 21 and Nov. 9 in the Schreyer Education Center at PMC,1 Plainsboro Road, Plainsboro, NJ.</p>

            <p>Please note, COVID vaccine boosters are not available at Princeton House flu vaccination events, which does not have the refrigeration and storage capabilities needed for the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>

            <p>Those interested in receiving the bivalent COVID-19 booster should bring their Princeton Health IDs and their original CDC Vaccination Record Cards.</p>

            <p>The CDC recommends the bivalent booster for all adults &mdash; including those who are immunocompromised &mdash; who received their most recent dose of COVID-19 vaccine at least two months ago. Individuals who were recently infected with COVID-19 may consider delaying a booster dose until three months after the onset of symptoms or a positive test. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html">Learn more from the CDC</a>.</p>

            <p>Individuals may receive flu shots and COVID-19 boosters on the same day. The CDC does not recommend any waiting period between vaccines.</p>
