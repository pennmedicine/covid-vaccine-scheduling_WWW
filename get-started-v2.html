            <p>Penn Medicine is currently providing third doses and boosters to the following employee groups:</p>
            <ol>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Employees who have severely weakened or compromised immune systems</strong> (severely immunocompromised) can receive a third dose of Pfizer or Moderna.<br>
                    <a href="#immuno-def">Who is considered severely immunocompromised?</a></li>
                <li><strong>Employees who are not immunocompromised and received two doses of Pfizer at least six months ago</strong> can receive a booster shot of Pfizer.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Employees who are not severely immunocompromised and received Moderna are <em>not eligible</em> for a booster shot at this time, consistent with CDC guidance.</p>

            <p>Unlike last winter, vaccines are now widely available.  If you are eligible, you have the option to receive a third dose or a booster shot at Penn Medicine or from your local pharmacy.</p>

            <p>If you are eligible to receive a third dose (severely immunocompromised) or a booster shot (at least six months since second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech), click the &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo; button below to login using your Penn Medicine network username and password.</p>
